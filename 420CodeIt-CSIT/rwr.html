<div>Southeaestern is home to the highest ranking Computer Science and Information Technology Program in Louisiana<br>
One of the reasons why is that we offer courses that give students skills that are applicable to the real world <br>
and will ensure that they are gainfully employed as soon as they graduate<br>

<h1>CMPS 285</h1>
<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
<div>In this course, Students will assemble a team of 3 to 6 students and work on a project of their choosing.<br>
Students will initially choose a client for whom they will develop a program of their choosing.<br>
Afterward, students will give a demonstration to show what the final product is expected to do.<br>
Presentations will be given throughout the cycle of the chosen project's development.</div>

<h1>CMPS 383</h1>
<h2>Information Systems</h2>
<div>Students will become familiar with the file structure, organization, and inner workings of information systems<br>
such as web applications through the development of a term project. Students go through five phases of development<br>
as they progress through the course. Starting out, students will be familiar with online project collaboration applications<br>
such as GitHub and BitBucket. They will learn through the first four phases how to design and develop<br>
