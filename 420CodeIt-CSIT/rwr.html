<h1><font color="white"><center>Real World Ready @ Southeastern</center></font></h1>

<hr>
<p>Southeaestern is home to the highest ranking Computer Science and Information Technology Program in Louisiana.<br>
One of the reasons why is that we offer courses that give students skills that are applicable to the real world <br>
and will ensure that they are gainfully employed as soon as they graduate<br>
</p>

<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
<p>In this course, Students will assemble a team of 3 to 6 students and work on a project of their choosing.<br>
Students will initially choose a client for whom they will develop a program of their choosing.<br>
Afterward, students will give a demonstration to show what the final product is expected to do.<br>
Presentations will be given throughout the cycle of the chosen project's development.</dp>

<h2>Information Systems</h2>
<p>Students will become familiar with the file structure, organization, and inner workings of information systems<br>
such as web applications through the development of a term project. Students go through five phases of development<br>
as they progress through the course. Starting out, students will be familiar with online project collaboration applications<br>
such as GitHub and BitBucket. They will learn through the first four phases how to design and develop<br>
information systems for a select company. The fifth and final phase, students will develop a full blown application<br>
designed to meet the needs of the company in question and may deploy it at the end of the semester</p>

Courses. They will assemble a team of up to four members. As a team, they will select a term project and<br/>
and work on it throughout the entire semester. The team is also responisible for working on the four lab<br/>
assignments that are done throughout the semester. The only individual assignments during the course are<br/>
the midterm, the final exam, and the project evaluations to be submitted after each presentation.</p>
